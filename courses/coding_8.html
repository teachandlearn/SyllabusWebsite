    <h6>Course Description and Guide</h6>

    <!-- Welcome and Course Summary -->
    <h3>Summary</h3>
    <p>Coding in grade eight is a course that is designed to introduce students to the problem solving process, key programming skills, collaboration techniques, and communication empowerment. The main focus of the course is to empower students to use javascript to make videogames.</p>
    
    <p>This course is centered around five main ideas. These ideas, chosen by Code.org, are used connect the lessons into a cohesive creative work.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Problem Solving</li>
      <li>Persistence</li>
      <li>Communication</li>
      <li>Collaboration</li>
      <li>Creativity</li>
    </ul>
    
    <p>Being able to used the 3 C's and 2 P's of this course will shape students abilities to solve problems in a collaborative environment whether they pursue a career in computing or not. I often say, "Even if you decide to forgo all technology, move into a hut, and become a hermit, the problem solving skills that you learn in this class will benefit you."

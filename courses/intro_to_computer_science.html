    <!-- Welcome and Course Summary -->
    <h3>Summary</h3>
    <p>Intro to Computer Science is a course provided and created by Code.org. This course is meant to serve as an introductory course that builds on the ideas of computer science introduced in 7th Grade Coding. However, if a student has not taken 7th Grade Coding, the student will be able to take this course.</p>

    <p>This course is centered around five main ideas. These ideas, chosen by Code.org, are used connect the lessons into a cohesive creative work, and the ideas foster great programmers.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Problem Solving</li>
      <li>Persistence</li>
      <li>Communication</li>
      <li>Collaboration</li>
      <li>Creativity</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Being able to used the 3 C's and 2 P's of this course will shape students abilities to solve problems in a collaborative environment whether they pursue a career in computing or not. I often say, "Even if you decide to forgo all technology, move into a hut, and become a hermit, the problem solving skills that you learn in this class will benefit you."

      <h3>Unit One: Problem Solving and Computing</h3>
      <p class="unit_description">
        This unit is an introductory unit to the Computer Science Discoveries curriculum. The unit covers two major topics. The first 
        chapter tackles the problem solving process, which will be used for all projects throughout the course. The second chapter builds
        a definition of a computer for the students. This definition is also used throughout the rest of the course.

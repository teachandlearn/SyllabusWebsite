Problem: 
The computer science curriculum in my school district is scattered across several grade levels, teachers, schools, and curricula. In order to create a central mapping
tool for the state standards, create a map for curricula in my district, and create a place for students to return to year after year, a tool needs to be created.

Goal: Create a website that:
  - Centralizes the curriculum that I teach and others teach for easy parent and student access
  - Provides tools for mapping computer science curriculum across multiple grades
  - Provides a tool for general announcements
  - Hosts Curricular supplements (like learning games and animamtions) that I create

Purpose:
  - Fulfill curriculum mapping requirements of my district
  - Improve teaching quality by giving students and parents a birds-eye view of curriculum 
  - Shows students intent in curriculum and gives them insight as to what the end goals are
  - Fosters increased connectivity between computer science classes taught in my district
  - Provide a hosting site for learning programs that I create

Tools:
  - The tools for creating this program were selected for the ease of access to students.
  - Website -> websites can be used accross devices and will work for many products. Plus, the main languages that I teach are HTML/CSS and Javascript. This gives students
               insight into what I teach.
  - Google Suite -> Much of the actual curriculum is already created on Google Suite. This is an ease of access for teachers and students alike. 
  - Code.org -> The majority of my, and the district's, curriculum is from Code.org.

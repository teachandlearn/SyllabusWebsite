            <h3>Welcome</h3>
            <p>
                Welcome to my website! This website serves as an 
                introduction to me, to the classes I teach, and to instructional materials
                that I have created.

            <h3>About Me</h3>
            <p>
              My name is Mr. Hillegonds, and I am an educator who believes in being interested in everything. In my teaching, my goal is to allow students to learn as much
              as they can about the world, eachother, and themselves. As they dig into learning as much as they can about as many different subjects as they can,
              they develop the skills and techniques necessary for lifelong learning, collaborative creating, critical thinking, and problem solving.

            <h3>Courses</h3>
            <p>
                I have taught a variety of courses over my career as a teacher. However, these are the courses that I currently teach. 
                The majority of the curriculum that I use is from <a href="https://www.code.org">Code.org</a>. However, I mapped it here 
                to make it easier for parents and students to access. I have also made small changes to the curriculum that make it easier
                to complete the units in the time provided by my school. 
                If you would like to see a full list of the classes that I have mapped for the Computer Science department in Highland, 
                click this <a href="courses/courses.html">link</a>. You can also click any of the classes to easily navigate to them.

        <h1>Mr. Ty Hillegonds</h1>

        <h3>Welcome</h3>
        <p>
            Welcome to my website! This website serves as an 
            introduction to me, to the classes I teach, and to instructional materials
            that I have created.
        </p>

        <h3>About Me</h3>

        <h3>Credentials</h3>
        <p>
            My path as an educator has varied over the years. I have been a reading, math, computer science, and science teacher.
            I have also led a science club and a coding club at my school for several years. My credentials are as follows:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Bachelor's Degree in Secondary Biology Education from Purdue University</li>
            <li>Indiana Licenses In: Biology, Computer Science, Middle School Math</li>
            <li>A Plethora of Training in Programming Using Codecademy</li>
            <li>Seven Years of Education</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Courses</h3>
        <p>
            I have taught a variety of courses over my career as a teacher. However, these are the courses that I currently teach. 
            The majority of the curriculum that I use is from <a href="https://www.code.org">Code.org</a>. However, I mapped it here 
            to make it easier for parents and students to access. I have also made small changes to the curriculum that make it easier
            to complete the units in the time provided by my school. 
            If you would like to see a full list of the classes that I have mapped for the Computer Science department in Highland, 
            click this <a href="courses/courses.html">link</a>. You can also click any of the classes to easily navigate to them.
